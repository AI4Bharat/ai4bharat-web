## AI4Bharat is built around projects

AI4Bharat has a flat organisation built around projects. A list of project statements are here. Each project will move through a lifecycle of problem discovery, solution building, and deployment. Some ideas on this process are [here](../articles/ai-process). Each project will be mentored by one or two experienced AI engineers and/or domain experts. Each project will additionally have engineering teams of size 2-5. Members of a project are expected to regularly e-meet, with a recommended frequency of once per week. All projects are required to update their progress monthly on the project pages. 

Each project page will include details of the current team and open positions, if any. Applicants are expected to go through these project pages and include the position they are applying for in the form below. 

## What is expected?

AI4Bharat is a voluntary community.  There is no financial benefit for any member. However, we will provide access to collaboration tools and cloud resources for storing data and running ML workloads. Also, in the near future, we do expect constitution of grand challenges that could come with prizes sponsored by industry or government.

We expect members to be driven by passion along lines outlined here. The time-commitment made by each individual could vary depending on the stage of the project and the role. We expect AI engineers to contribute contribute at least 5-10 hours per week. Mentors are expected to spend at least 1-2 hours reviewing a project per week. 

## Application Process

You can apply to join AI4Bharat by filling in the form below. The application will be evaluated by an internal team and a decision will be communicated as soon as possible. 

We plan to start with a small community and hence we will be selective initially. Once, we have fine-tuned internal processes and identified best practices, we will aim to scale up to include a larger team.
